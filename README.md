Completed as part of the Deep Learning course at IMT Atlantique in December 2024, during the MSc in Data Science program.

The objective of the project was to model non-constant variance in auto-regression order 1 time series models.
As such, the primary focus was on the developement of the loss functions for the different assumptions.

The project report is in French but the slides and the notebook are in English.
